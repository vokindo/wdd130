        <p> Hello, my name is Victor Okindo and i am from Kenya. All along i have never known what excites me most in terms of work until i learnt about BYU Pathway and BYU Idaho.
            In BYU, i got introduced into software development online degree course that changed my all perspective of viewing life. I got to learn on how to program using python and it made me feel happy and relaxed. I can't wait to challenge myself more.</p>
